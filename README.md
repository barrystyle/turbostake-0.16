TurboStake Official Development Repo
====================================

### What is this?

Turbostake rebase (based on Peercoin 0.16.3) retaining compatibility with legacy client for the meantime.

All consensus, reward and timing figures are as per existing client (https://github.com/TurboStake/TurboStake).


### Why this release?

Peercoin recently had a refresh of their codebase over Bitcoin 0.16.3 (peercoin branch 'rebase'); by using this base (and fixing several bugs along the way), Turbostake 0.16 was born - with full compatibility with the legacy client (https://github.com/TurboStake/TurboStake).
