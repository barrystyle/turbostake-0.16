TurboStake Core
=============

Intro
-----
TurboStake is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run turbostake-qt.exe.

TurboStake Core is the original TurboStake client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of TurboStake transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
